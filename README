- This is a forward DCNN program, which is compatibility with caffe's caffemodel file,
  with both CPU and GPU mode.

- How to install:
	- Requirements:
		- Cmake 2.8 +
		- gcc/g++ 4.8.4 +
	- How to switch between with CPU and GPU mode 
		- CPU: forward-caffe/CMakeLists.txt line 9 
			option(CPU_ONLY "Build Jaffe without CUDA support" ON)
		- GPU: forward-caffe/CMakeLists.txt line 9 
			option(CPU_ONLY "Build Jaffe without CUDA support" OFF)
	- install:
		- cd forward-caffe
		- mkdir build
		- cd build
		- cmake ..
		- make -j8 or make -j4

- Use classification test script:
	- If you want to run classification.sh, you should download the caffemodel by
	  yourself, which is bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel. And place it in folder 
	  /res/classification/.
	- When you done preparing the caffemodel file, edit classification.sh to make
	  sure that you are going to use the right gpu.(Keeping the gpu_id parameter is 
      OK when running under CPU mode).
